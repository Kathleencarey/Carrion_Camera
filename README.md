# Analyses and data for: Lahiri A., Carey K.A., Barton B., Cove M.V., Baruzzi C. Camera Trap Design Determines Wildlife Species Detected at Carrion Sites. Ecology and Evolution, In Review 
This repository provides the data and R code to reproduce the analyses from: Lahiri A., Carey K.A., Barton B., Cove M.V., Baruzzi C. Combining Camera Trap Designs Increase Scavenger Species Detection at Carrion Sites. Ecology and Evolution, In Review.

## Data Folder Description
1. The dataset `Camera_Richness.csv` contains data on the first analysis in the article: species richness between the vertical and horizontal camera trap design.
2. The dataset `Camera_Detections.csv` contains data on the perMANOVA community composition analysis and the indicator species analysis between the vertical and horizontal camera trap design. 

## Code Folder Description
1. The file `Camera_Richness.R` runs the code for the species richness analysis between the vertical and horizontal camera trap design, the split-violin figure, and the supplementary table 1.
2. The file `Camera_Community_Composition.R` runs the code for the perMANOVA community composition analysis between the vertical and horizontal camera trap design and the non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination figure by month.
3. The file `Camera_Indicator_Species.R` runs the code for the indicator species analysis between the vertical and horizontal camera trap design.
